## üì• Cloning the Project

```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting up your Environment

1. **After cloning**, navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd asp-dotnet-movies/MovieApp
   ```

2. **Create a `.env` file** inside the `MovieApp/` directory.

   - You **must** have a `.env` file at this path:  
     ‚ûî `asp-dotnet-movies/MovieApp/.env`

   - I will provide this `.env` file separately by email together with the repository link.

   - The `.env` file should look like this:

     ```env
     API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key_here
     BEARER_TOKEN=your_tmdb_bearer_token_here
     ```

3. **Restore dependencies**:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Run the project**:

   ```bash
   dotnet run --project MovieApp
   ```

## üßπ Notes

- The `.env` file is ignored from GitHub (`.gitignore`) for security reasons.
- Without a valid `.env` file, the project will not be able to fetch movie data from TMDB.
- When sharing the project internally, always separately share the `.env` file.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Tips

- All external API communication is abstracted in the `Services/TmdbService.cs` file.
- Comments are managed via the `Repositories/CommentRepository.cs`.
